2. Identify the **relevant entities, attributes, and relationships** together with any constraints and properties.
   
3. Produce an **E-R diagram** for the database.

4. Convert the E-R diagrams to **relational schemas** (clearly indicating the **primary keys, foreign keys, functional and/or multivalued dependencies**, as well as justifying that your designs are in good, **normalized form**).
