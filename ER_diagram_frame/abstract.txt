Title: A Supermarket Management Database System Based on Entity-Relationship Model

Abstract:
In order to meet the big needs of supermarket management in life, we designed a supermarket management database system based on entity-relationship model. This system includes five subsystems, which are product management system, product supply system, product sales system, employee management system, and marketing reporting system. Keys and constraints within and across subsystems have been verified to adhere to optimal database structure standards. Additionally, routine queries including practical daily operations and data mining tasks, are systematically implemented to ensure efficient data manipulation and analysis. Furthermore, we introduce large language models (LLM) to refine our database system design, mainly for two points. Firstly, we leverage LLM to enhance the integrity, independence, and efficient data access of our databases. Secondly, we investigate methods for creating prompts that guide LLM to generate precise database queries for information extraction. In conclusion, this system aims to offer a functional tool for improving supermarket management tasks, thereby contributing to the relevance and utility of database systems in real-world applications.
